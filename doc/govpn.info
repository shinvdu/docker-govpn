File: govpn.info,  Node: Why not TLS,  Next: Why not SSH,  Up: FAQ

Why do not you use TLS?
=======================

   • It is complicated badly designed protocol.
   • It uses Authenticate-then-Encrypt ordering of algorithms.
   • Its libraries are huge and hard to read, review and analyze.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why not SSH,  Next: Why not IPsec,  Prev: Why not TLS,  Up: FAQ

Why do not you use SSH?
=======================

   • Its first protocol versions used A-a-E ordering, however later ones
     supports even ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms.
   • OpenSSH does not support strong zero-knowledge password
     authentication.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why not IPsec,  Next: Why Go,  Prev: Why not SSH,  Up: FAQ

Why do not you use IPsec?
=========================

It lacks strong zero-knowledge password authentication and, again, its
code is hard to read.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why Go,  Next: Why passphrases,  Prev: Why not IPsec,  Up: FAQ

Why GoVPN is written on Go?
===========================

Go is very easy to read, review and support.  It makes complex code
writing a harder task.  It provides everything needed to the C language:
array bounds checking, garbage collection and concurrency primitives.
It provides lesser performance (however my setup on the notebook gives
more than 750 Mbps of throughput), but higher reliability and much fewer
lines of code.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why passphrases,  Next: Why manual network configuration,  Prev: Why Go,  Up: FAQ

Why do you authenticate with passphrases?
=========================================

Human is capable of memorizing rather long passphrases (not passwords):
100-200 characters, that gives ability to use it as a high-entropy key.
You need to trust only yourself, neither hardware token nor some other
storage device.  It is convenient.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why manual network configuration,  Next: Why no proprietary OS support,  Prev: Why passphrases,  Up: FAQ

Why all network configuration must be done manually?
====================================================

Because there are so many use-cases and setups, so many various
protocols, that either I support all of them, or use complicated
protocol setups like PPP, or just give right of the choice to the
administrator.  VPN is only just a layer, just like Ethernet cable.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why no proprietary OS support,  Next: What is perfect forward secrecy,  Prev: Why manual network configuration,  Up: FAQ

Why there is no either OS X or Windows support?
===============================================

Any closed source proprietary systems do not give ability to control the
computer.  You can not securely use cryptography-related stuff without
controlling the underlying computing device.  Choose another operating
system.


File: govpn.info,  Node: What is perfect forward secrecy,  Next: What is anonymity,  Prev: Why no proprietary OS support,  Up: FAQ

What do you mean by perfect forward secrecy?
============================================

You can not decrypt previously saved traffic by compromising long-lived
keys.  PFS property is per-session level: it won’t protect from leaking
the session key from the memory.


File: govpn.info,  Node: What is anonymity,  Next: What is censorship resistance,  Prev: What is perfect forward secrecy,  Up: FAQ

What do you mean by saying that clients are anonymous?
======================================================

That third-party can not differentiate one client from another looking
at the traffic (transport and handshake).


File: govpn.info,  Node: What is censorship resistance,  Next: When encryptionless mode,  Prev: What is anonymity,  Up: FAQ

What do you mean by censorship resistance?
==========================================

Unability to distinguish either is it GoVPN-traffic is passing by, or
just ‘cat /dev/urandom | nc somehost’.  If you can not differentiate one
kind of traffic from another, then your only option is to forbid all
kinds of it.


File: govpn.info,  Node: When encryptionless mode,  Next: When noise option,  Prev: What is censorship resistance,  Up: FAQ

When should I use *note encryptionless mode: Encless.?
======================================================

If you are operating under jurisdiction where courts can either sue you
for encryption usage or force you to somehow reveal you encryption keys
(however new session encryption keys are generated each session).  Those
courts can not demand for authentication and signing keys in most cases.

   *Do not* let mode’s name to confuse you: it still provides
confidentiality and authenticity of transmitted data!  But pay attention
that this mode is traffic and resource hungry and currently operate only
in TCP mode.

   If anything that can not be read by anyone is considered encryption,
then encryptionless mode won’t help you.  Imagine that either you are
talking on another foreign language, or just use another date encoding
scheme.


File: govpn.info,  Node: When noise option,  Next: When timesync option,  Prev: When encryptionless mode,  Up: FAQ

When should I use *note noise: Noise. option?
=============================================

In most cases you won’t need it without *note constant packer rate: CPR.
turned on.  Without CPR and noise options GoVPN traffic (like TLS,
IPsec, SSH and other VPN protocols) leaks underlying interface’s packets
timestamps and sizes.  You can run traffic analysis and predict what is
going on in the network.  With CPR option enabled you can tell either
somebody is online, or not – nothing less, nothing more.


File: govpn.info,  Node: When timesync option,  Next: Can I DoS daemon,  Prev: When noise option,  Up: FAQ

When should I use *note time synchronization: Timesync. option?
===============================================================

Without that option, if someone captured initial handshake packet from
the valid client, then it could repeat it and receive a handshake packet
as an answer from server.  This can be used to detect if some user’s
identity is known to server and that it is exactly GoVPN server.
Timesync option forces adding timestamps to each handshake packet
allowing only specified time window of packet validness.  If you have
got more or less synchronized clocks between your clients and server,
then you can always use this option.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Can I DoS daemon,  Next: Why YAML,  Prev: When timesync option,  Up: FAQ

Can I DoS (denial of service) the daemon?
=========================================

Each transport packet is authenticated first with the very fast UMAC
algorithm – in most cases resource consumption of TCP/UDP layers will be
higher then UMAC verifying.  Each handshake message is processed only
when an encrypted client’s *note identity: Identity. is found: it uses
fast PRP without any entropy usage.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Why YAML,  Prev: Can I DoS daemon,  Up: FAQ

Why YAML for configuration?
===========================

There are not so many well-known formats that allow commenting, easy
editing by human (XML is not human friendly at all, JSON is more or
less).  Probably the most useful feature is YAML’s templates: it is very
convenient for storing many clients sharing the same options in the
configuration file.

File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.7,  Next: Release 5.6,  Up: News

Release 5.7
===========

   • TAP interface name and remote peer’s address are passed to up- and
     down- scripts through environment variables.
   • Update Argon2 library to use version 1.3 of the algorithm.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.6,  Next: Release 5.5,  Prev: Release 5.7,  Up: News

Release 5.6
===========

   • Added up/down example script for replacing default route (thanks to
     Zhuoyun Wei).
   • Fixed documentation bug: ‘.info’ was not installing.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.5,  Next: Release 5.4,  Prev: Release 5.6,  Up: News

Release 5.5
===========

   • Ability to work on 32-bit platforms.  _sync/atomic_ library has
     some specific issues that caused panics on previous versions.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.4,  Next: Release 5.3,  Prev: Release 5.5,  Up: News

Release 5.4
===========

   • Added optional *note time synchronization: Timesync. requirement.
     It will add timestamps in handshake PRP authentication, disallowing
     to repeat captured packet and get reply from the server, making it
     visible to DPI.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.3,  Next: Release 5.2,  Prev: Release 5.4,  Up: News

Release 5.3
===========

   • Fixed minor bug with ‘newclient.sh’ that caught "Passphrase:"
     prompt and inserted it into example YAML output.  Just replaced
     stdout output to stderr for that prompt.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.2,  Next: Release 5.1,  Prev: Release 5.3,  Up: News

Release 5.2
===========

   • Ability to read passphrases directly from the terminal (user’s
     input) without using of keyfiles.  ‘storekey.sh’ utility removed.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.1,  Next: Release 5.0,  Prev: Release 5.2,  Up: News

Release 5.1
===========

   • Server is configured using YAML (http://yaml.org/) file.  It is
     very convenient to have comments and templates, comparing to JSON.
   • Incompatible with previous versions replacement of _HSalsa20_ with
     _BLAKE2b_ in handshake code.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 5.0,  Next: Release 4.2,  Prev: Release 5.1,  Up: News

Release 5.0
===========

   • New optional *note encryptionless mode: Encless. of operation.
     Technically no encryption functions are applied for outgoing
     packets, so you can not be forced to reveal your encryption keys or
     sued for encryption usage.
   • *note MTU::s are configured on per-user basis.
   • Simplified payload padding scheme, saving one byte of data.
   • Ability to specify TAP interface name explicitly without any
     up-scripts for convenience.
   • ‘govpn-verifier’ utility also can use *note EGD::.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 4.2,  Next: Release 4.1,  Prev: Release 5.0,  Up: News

Release 4.2
===========

   • Fixed non-critical bug when server may fail if up-script is not
     executed successfully.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 4.1,  Next: Release 4.0,  Prev: Release 4.2,  Up: News

Release 4.1
===========

   • Argon2d (https://password-hashing.net/#argon2) is used instead of
     PBKDF2 for password verifier hashing.
   • Client’s identity is stored inside the verifier, so it simplifies
     server-side configuration and the code.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 4.0,  Next: Release 3.5,  Prev: Release 4.1,  Up: News

Release 4.0
===========

   • Handshake messages can be noised: their messages lengths are
     hidden.  Now they are indistinguishable from transport messages.
   • Parallelized clients processing on the server side.
   • Much higher overall performance.
   • Single JSON file server configuration.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.5,  Next: Release 3.4,  Prev: Release 4.0,  Up: News

Release 3.5
===========

   • Ability to use *note TCP: Network. network transport.  Server can
     listen on both UDP and TCP sockets.
   • Ability to use *note HTTP proxies: Proxy. (through CONNECT method)
     for accessing the server.  Server can also emulate HTTP proxy
     behaviour.
   • Updated Poly1305 library with ARM-related bugfixes.
   • Go 1.5+ version is highly recommended because of performance
     reasons.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.4,  Next: Release 3.3,  Prev: Release 3.5,  Up: News

Release 3.4
===========

   • Ability to use external *note EGD::-compatible PRNGs.  Now you are
     able to use GoVPN even on systems with the bad ‘/dev/random’,
     providing higher quality entropy from external sources.
   • Removed ‘-noncediff’ option.  It is replaced with in-memory storage
     of seen nonces, thus eliminating possible replay attacks at all
     without performance degradation related to inbound packets
     reordering.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.3,  Next: Release 3.2,  Prev: Release 3.4,  Up: News

Release 3.3
===========

   • Compatibility with an old GNU Make 3.x.  Previously only BSD Make
     and GNU Make 4.x were supported.
   • ‘/dev/urandom’ is used for correct client identity generation under
     GNU/Linux systems.  Previously ‘/dev/random’ can produce less than
     required 128-bits of random.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.2,  Next: Release 3.1,  Prev: Release 3.3,  Up: News

Release 3.2
===========

   • Deterministic building: dependent libraries source code commits are
     fixed in our makefiles.
   • No Internet connection is needed for building the source code: all
     required libraries are included in release tarballs.
   • FreeBSD Make compatibility.  GNU Make is not necessary anymore.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.1,  Next: Release 3.0,  Prev: Release 3.2,  Up: News

Release 3.1
===========

   • Diffie-Hellman public keys are encoded with Elligator algorithm
     when sending over the wire, making them indistinguishable from the
     random strings, preventing detection of successful decryption try
     when guessing passwords (that are used to create DSA public keys).
     But this will consume twice entropy for DH key generation in
     average.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 3.0,  Next: Release 2.4,  Prev: Release 3.1,  Up: News

Release 3.0
===========

   • EKE protocol is replaced by Augmented-EKE and static symmetric
     (both sides have it) pre-shared key replaced with server-side
     verifier.  This requires, 64 more bytes in handshake traffic,
     Ed25519 dependency with corresponding sign/verify computations,
     PBKDF2 dependency and its usage on the client side during
     handshake.

     A-EKE with PBKDF2-based verifiers is resistant to dictionary
     attacks, can use human memorable passphrases instead of static keys
     and server-side verifiers can not be used for authentication
     (compromised server does not leak client’s authentication
     keys/passphrases).

   • Changed transport message structure: added payload packet’s length.
     This will increase transport overhead for two bytes, but heartbeat
     packets became smaller

   • Ability to hide underlying packets lengths by appending noise, junk
     data during transmission.  Each packet can be fill up-ed to its
     maximal MTU size.

   • Ability to hide underlying packets appearance rate, by generating
     Constant Packet Rate traffic.  This includes noise generation too.
   • Per-peer ‘-timeout’, ‘-noncediff’, ‘-noise’ and ‘-cpr’
     configuration options for server.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 2.4,  Next: Release 2.3,  Prev: Release 3.0,  Up: News

Release 2.4
===========

   • Added ability to optionally run built-in HTTP-server responding
     with JSON of all known connected peers information.  Real-time
     client’s statistics.
   • Documentation is explicitly licenced under GNU FDL 1.3+.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 2.3,  Next: Release 2.2,  Prev: Release 2.4,  Up: News

Release 2.3
===========

   • Handshake packets became indistinguishable from the random.  Now
     all GoVPN’s traffic is the noise for men in the middle.

   • Handshake messages are smaller (16% traffic reduce).

   • Adversary now can not create malicious fake handshake packets that
     will force server to generate private DH key, preventing entropy
     consuming and resource heavy computations.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 2.2,  Next: Release 2.1,  Prev: Release 2.3,  Up: News

Release 2.2
===========

   • Fixed several possible channel deadlocks.

Release 2.1
===========

   • Fixed Linux-related building.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 2.0,  Next: Release 1.5,  Prev: Release 2.1,  Up: News

Release 2.0
===========

   • Added clients identification.
   • Simultaneous several clients support by server.
   • Per-client up/down scripts.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Release 1.5,  Next: Release 1.4,  Prev: Release 2.0,  Up: News

Release 1.5

Почему вы не используете TLS?
-----------------------------

   • Это сложный плохо спроектированный протокол.
   • Он использует Аутентификацию-затем-Шифрование порядок использования
     алгоритмов.
   • Его библиотеки огромны и сложны для чтения, ревью и анализа.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему не SSH,  Next: Почему не IPsec,  Prev: Почему не TLS,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему вы не используете SSH?
-----------------------------

   • Его первые версии использовали Аутентификацию-и-Шифрование порядок,
     однако более поздние поддерживают даже ChaCha20-Poly1305 алгоритм.
   • OpenSSH не поддерживает сильные протоколы аутентификации по паролю
     с нулевым неразглашением.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему не IPsec,  Next: Почему Go,  Prev: Почему не SSH,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему вы не используете IPsec?
-------------------------------

В нём нет сильного протокола аутентификации по паролю с нулевым
неразглашением и, снова, его код сложно читать.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему Go,  Next: Почему парольные фразы,  Prev: Почему не IPsec,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему GoVPN написан на Go?
---------------------------

Go очень легко читается, поддаётся ревью и поддержке.  Он усложняет
написание сложного кода.  Он предоставляет всё что нужно для C языка:
проверки границ массивов, сборщик мусора и конкурентные примитивы.  Он
обеспечивает меньшую производительность (хотя на моём ноутбуке даёт
более чем 750 Mbps пропускной способности), но большую надёжность и
гораздо меньше строк кода.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему парольные фразы,  Next: Почему ручная настройка сети,  Prev: Почему Go,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему вы аутентифицируете по парольной фразе?
----------------------------------------------

Человек способ запоминать достаточно длинные парольные фразы (не
пароли): 100-200 символов, что даёт возможность использовать её как
высокоэнтропийный ключ.  Вам нужно доверять только себе, не аппаратному
токену или другому устройству хранения.  Это удобно.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему ручная настройка сети,  Next: Почему нет поддержки проприетарных ОС,  Prev: Почему парольные фразы,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему вся настройка сети делается вручную?
-------------------------------------------

Потому-что существует так много вариантов использования, конфигураций и
установок, что или я поддерживаю их всех, или использую громоздкие
протоколы типы PPP, или просто даю право выбора администратору.  VPN это
всего-лишь прослойка.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему нет поддержки проприетарных ОС,  Next: Что такое PFS,  Prev: Почему ручная настройка сети,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему нет поддержки OS X или Windows?
--------------------------------------

Любые проприетарные системы с закрытым исходным кодом не дают
возможности управлять компьютером.  Вы не можете безопасно использовать
всё что касается криптографии без контроля над нижестоящим
вычислительным устройством.  Выбирайте другую операционную систему.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Что такое PFS,  Next: Что такое анонимность,  Prev: Почему нет поддержки проприетарных ОС,  Up: ЧАВО

Что вы подразумеваете под совершенной прямой секретностью?
----------------------------------------------------------

Что вы не можете дешифровать ранее перехваченный трафик если ваши
долгоживущие ключи будут скомпрометированы.  Это свойство работает на
уровне сессии: оно не спасёт если сессионный ключ скомпрометирован из
памяти.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Что такое анонимность,  Next: Что такое цензуроустойчивость,  Prev: Что такое PFS,  Up: ЧАВО

Что вы подразумеваете когда говорите что клиенты анонимны?
----------------------------------------------------------

Что третьей лицо не может отличить одного клиента от другого, смотря на
трафик (транспортный или рукопожатия).


File: govpn.info,  Node: Что такое цензуроустойчивость,  Next: Когда нешифрованный режим,  Prev: Что такое анонимность,  Up: ЧАВО

Что вы подразумеваете под цензуроустойчивостью?
-----------------------------------------------

Невозможность определить GoVPN ли это трафик или просто ‘cat
/dev/urandom | nc somehost’.  Если вы не можете отличить один вид
трафика от другого, то при цензуре ваше единственный вариант это
заблокировать все его виды.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Когда нешифрованный режим,  Next: Когда noise опцию,  Prev: Что такое цензуроустойчивость,  Up: ЧАВО

Когда я должен использовать *note нешифрованный режим: Encless.?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Если вы работаете под юрисдикциями где суды могут привлечь вас к
ответственности за использование шифрования или могут вынудить вас
как-либо выдать ваши ключи шифрования (хотя сессионные ключи шифрования
генерируются каждую сессию).  В большинстве случаев, эти суды не могут
требовать аутентификационные ключи или ключи для ЭЦП.

   *Не позволяйте* названию режима вас смутить: он всё-равно
обеспечивает конфиденциальность и аутентичность передаваемых данных!  Но
имейте в виду, что этот режим требователен к ресурсам и трафику и пока
работает только в TCP режиме.

   Если всё что не может быть прочитано кем-угодно считается
шифрованием, то этот режим вам не поможет.  Представьте что вы говорите
на другом иностранном языке или просто используете другую схему
кодирования данных.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Когда noise опцию,  Next: Когда синхронизацию времени,  Prev: Когда нешифрованный режим,  Up: ЧАВО

Когда я должен использовать *note noise: Noise. опцию?
------------------------------------------------------

В большинстве случаев она вам не нужна без включённого *note постоянного
по скорости трафика: CPR. (CPR). Без CPR и шума, в GoVPN трафике (так же
как и в TLS, IPsec, SSH и других VPN протоколах) утекает информация о
размерах и временных характеристиках пакетов нижележащего уровня.  Вы
можете делать анализ трафика и предполагать что происходить в сети.  Без
CPR опции вы можете только сказать в online ли кто или нет – ни больше,
ни меньше.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Когда синхронизацию времени,  Next: Можно ли DoS демона,  Prev: Когда noise опцию,  Up: ЧАВО

Когда я должен использовать опцию *note синхронизации времени: Timesync.?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Без этой опции, если кто-либо перехватит первоначальный пакет
рукопожатия от настоящего клиента, то он сможет его повторить и получить
пакет рукопожатия от сервера в ответ.  Это может быть использовано для
определения известен ли определённый пользователь серверу и то что мы
имеем дело именно с GoVPN сервером.  Timesync опция заставляет добавлять
временные штампы в пакеты рукопожатия, разрешая быть пакетам
действительными только в указанном временном окне.  Если вы имеете более
или менее синхронизированные часы между вашими клиентами и сервером, то
можете всего использовать эту опцию.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Можно ли DoS демона,  Next: Почему YAML,  Prev: Когда синхронизацию времени,  Up: ЧАВО

Могу ли я сделать DoS (отказ в обслуживании) демона?
----------------------------------------------------

Каждый транспортный пакет первым делом аутентифицируется очень быстрым
UMAC алгоритмом – в большинстве случаев потребление ресурсов TCP/UDP
слоёв будет выше чем проверка UMAC. Каждое сообщение рукопожатия
обрабатывается только если зашифрованный *note идентификатор: Identity.
клиента найден: он использует быстрый PRP без потребления энтропии.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Почему YAML,  Prev: Можно ли DoS демона,  Up: ЧАВО

Почему YAML для конфигурации?
-----------------------------

Есть не так много хорошо известных форматов позволяющих комментировать,
легко редактировать людьми (XML совсем не дружелюбен к человеку, JSON
более менее).  Возможно самое важное свойство это шаблоны YAML: очень
удобно сохранить много клиентов, имеющих схожие настройки, в одном
конфигурационном файле.

Релиз 5.7
---------

   • Имя TAP интерфейса и адрес удалённой стороны теперь передаются в
     up- и down- скрипты через переменные окружения.
   • Argon2 библиотека обновлена чтобы использовать 1.3 версию
     алгоритма.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.6,  Next: Релиз 5.5,  Prev: Релиз 5.7,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.6
---------

   • Добавлен up/down скрипт-пример для подмены маршрута по-умолчанию
     (спасибо Zhuoyun Wei).
   • Исправлена ошибка при генерировании документации: ‘.info’ файл не
     устанавливался.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.5,  Next: Релиз 5.4,  Prev: Релиз 5.6,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.5
---------

   • Возможность работы на 32-х битных платформах.  _sync/atomic_
     библиотека имеет особенности из-за которых предыдущие версии
     паниковали.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.4,  Next: Релиз 5.3,  Prev: Релиз 5.5,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.4
---------

   • Добавлена возможность требования *note синхронизации времени:
     Timesync.  Она добавит временные метки в PRP аутентификацию
     сообщений рукопожатия, не позволяя повторить ранее перехваченные
     пакеты и получить ответ от сервера, делая его видимым для DPI.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.3,  Next: Релиз 5.2,  Prev: Релиз 5.4,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.3
---------

   • Исправлен небольшой баг связанный с тем что ‘newclient.sh’ ловил
     "Passphrase:" приглашение и помещал его в примерный вывод YAML.
     Просто заменил вывод приглашения ввода парольной фразы с stdout на
     stderr.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.2,  Next: Релиз 5.1,  Prev: Релиз 5.3,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.2
---------

     (пользовательский ввод), без использования файлов с ключами.
     Утилита ‘storekey.sh’ удалена.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.1,  Next: Релиз 5.0,  Prev: Релиз 5.2,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.1
---------

   • Сервер конфигурируется через YAML (http://yaml.org/) файл.  Очень
     удобно иметь комментарии и шаблоны, по сравнению с JSON.
   • Несовместимая с предыдущими версиями замена функции _HSalsa20_ на
     _BLAKE2b_ в коде рукопожатия.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 5.0,  Next: Релиз 4.2,  Prev: Релиз 5.1,  Up: Новости

Релиз 5.0
---------

   • Новый опциональный *note нешифрованный режим: Encless. работы.
     Технически к исходящим пакетам не применяются функции шифрования,
     поэтому вас не могут вынудить выдать ключи шифрования или привлечь
     к ответственности за использования шифрования.
   • *note MTU:: конфигурируются относительно каждого пользователя
     отдельно.
   • Упрощённая схема дополнения полезной нагрузки, экономия в один
     байт.
   • Возможность указать название TAP интерфейса явно, без использования
     up-скриптов.
   • ‘govpn-verifier’ утилита теперь может использовать *note EGD::.

     скрипт запуска (up.sh) не выполнился успешно.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 4.1,  Next: Релиз 4.0,  Prev: Релиз 4.2,  Up: Новости

Релиз 4.1
---------

   • Вместо PBKDF2 используется Argon2d
     (https://password-hashing.net/#argon2) алгоритм хэширования
     паролей.
   • Идентификатор клиента хранится внутри проверяльщика (verifier), тем
     самым упрощая конфигурирование сервера и код.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 4.0,  Next: Релиз 3.5,  Prev: Релиз 4.1,  Up: Новости

Релиз 4.0
---------

   • Сообщения рукопожатия могут быть зашумлены: их длина скрывается.
     Теперь они неотличимы от транспортных сообщений.
   • Распараллеленная обработка клиентов на стороне сервера.
   • Гораздо более высокая общая производительность.
   • Конфигурирование сервера единственным JSON файлом.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.5,  Next: Релиз 3.4,  Prev: Релиз 4.0,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.5
---------

   • Возможность использовать *note TCP: Network. сетевой транспорт.
     Сервер можно слушать одновременно на UDP и TCP сокетах.
   • Возможность использовать *note HTTP прокси: Proxy. (через CONNECT
     метод) для доступа к серверу.  Сервер может эмулировать поведение
     HTTP прокси.
   • Обновлённая Poly1305 библиотека с исправлениями для ARM.
   • Версия Go 1.5+ сильно рекомендуется из-за вопросов
     производительности.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.4,  Next: Релиз 3.3,  Prev: Релиз 3.5,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.4
---------

   • Возможность использовать внешний *note EGD:: совместимый PRNG.
     Теперь вы можете использовать GoVPN даже на системах с плохим
     ‘/dev/random’.
   • Опция ‘-noncediff’ удалена.  Она заменена на хранилище уже
     замеченных nonce-ов в памяти, тем самым полностью убирая
     возможность атак перепроигрывания без потерь производительности
     связанных с перетасовкой пакетов.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.3,  Next: Релиз 3.2,  Prev: Релиз 3.4,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.3
---------

   • Совместимость со старым GNU Make 3.x.  Прежде только BSD Make и GNU
     Make 4.x поддерживались.
   • ‘/dev/urandom’ используется для правильного генерирования
     идентификатора клиента под GNU/Linux системами.  Прежде,
     ‘/dev/random’ мог выдать меньше ожидаемого количества данных.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.2,  Next: Релиз 3.1,  Prev: Релиз 3.3,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.2
---------

   • Детерминированная сборка: коммиты исходного кода зависимых
     библиотек фиксированы.
   • Для сборки из исходного кода, соединение с Интернетом больше не
     требуется: все зависимые библиотеки включены в tarball релизов.
   • Совместимость с FreeBSD Make.  GNU Make не обязателен больше.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.1,  Next: Релиз 3.0,  Prev: Релиз 3.2,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.1
---------

   • Публичные ключи Диффи-Хельмана кодируются алгоритмом Elligator
     перед отправкой, делая их неотличимыми от случайных строчек,
     предотвращая определение удачного подбора ключа дешифрования при
     переборе паролей (используемых для создания DSA публичных ключей).
     Однако это в среднем потребляет в два раза больше энтропии при
     генерировании клюей DH.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 3.0,  Next: Релиз 2.4,  Prev: Релиз 3.1,  Up: Новости

Релиз 3.0
---------

   • EKE протокол заменён на Augmented-EKE и статичный симметричный (обе
     стороны его имеют) pre-shared ключ заменён на верификатор на
     стороне сервера.  Это требует на 64 байта больше трафика
     рукопожатия, добавляет Ed25519 зависимость с соответствующими
     расходами на подпись и проверку, PBKDF2 зависимость и вычисления на
     стороне клиента.

     A-EKE с PBKDF2 верификаторами устойчивы к атакам по словарю.  Можно
     использовать легко запоминаемые человеком парольные фразы вместо
     статичных ключей.  Верификаторы на стороне сервера не могут быть
     использованы для аутентификации (скомпрометированный сервер не даст
     возможность масксироваться под пользователя).

   • Изменена структура транспортных сообщений: добавлена длина полезной
     нагрузки.  Это увеличивает накладные расходы на два байта, но
     сообщения сердцебиения стали меньше.

   • Возможность скрывать размер полезной нагрузки за счёт добавления
     шума, мусора во время передачи данных.  Каждый пакет дополняется до
     максимального размера MTU.

   • Возможность скрывать факты появления пакетов полезной нагрузки, за
     счёт константного по скорости трафика.  Это также включает в себя
     создание шума.

   • Опции конфигурации ‘-timeout’, ‘-noncediff’, ‘-noise’, ‘-cpr’
     настраиваются по-клиентно.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 2.4,  Next: Релиз 2.3,  Prev: Релиз 3.0,  Up: Новости

Релиз 2.4
---------

   • Возможность запуска встроенного HTTP-сервера отвечающего JSON-ом с
     статистикой обо всех подключённых клиентах.
   • Документация явно лицензирована под GNU FDL 1.3+.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Релиз 2.3,  Next: Релиз 2.2,  Prev: Релиз 2.4,  Up: Новости

Релиз 2.3
---------

   • Пакеты рукопожатия стали неотличимыми от случайных данных.  Теперь
     весь GoVPN трафик это шум для человека по середине.

   • Сообщения рукопожатия стали меньше (16% сокращения трафика).

   • Злоумышленник не может создать обманных пакеты рукопожатия которые
     заставят сервер генерировать приватный DH ключ, предотвращая
     потребление энтропии и ресурсоёмкие вычисления.

Installation
************

Possibly GoVPN already exists in your distribution:

   • AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/govpn/)
   • FreeBSD ports (http://www.freshports.org/security/govpn/)

   GoVPN is written on Go (https://golang.org/) programming language and
you have to install Go compiler (1.5+ version is highly recommended, 1.4
is the minimal sufficient): ‘lang/go’ port in FreeBSD and ‘golang’
package in most GNU/Linux distributions.  _Make_ (BSD and GNU ones are
fine) is recommended for convenient building.  Texinfo
(https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) (6.1+ version is recommended) is
used for building documentation.  Possibly you also need to install
TUN/TAP interface utilities (depending on your operating system):
‘uml-utilities’ package in most GNU/Linux distributions.

   Included required libraries:

Development source code
=======================

Development source code contains the latest version of the code.  It may
be buggy.  It does not contain compiled documentation and dependent
libraries source code.  Because of that, it is not recommended for
porters: use *note Tarballs:: instead.

   You can obtain it by cloning Git (http://git-scm.com/) repository
(http://git.cypherpunks.ru/cgit.cgi/govpn.git/log/) and fetching
dependent libraries source code as git submodules:

% git clone git://git.cypherpunks.ru/govpn.git govpn
% cd govpn
% git checkout develop
% git submodule update --init

   Also there is mirror of dependent libraries for safety if their
native repositories will be unavailable (they are seldom updated):

Precautions
***********

  1. We use passphrase authentication, so overall security fully depends
     on its strength.  You *should* use long, high-entropy passphrases.
     Also remember to keep passphrase in temporary file and read it
     securely as described in *note verifier: Verifier.

  2. You must *never* use the same key for multiple clients.

  3. You must use *cryptographically good* pseudo random number
     generator.  By default we use default ‘crypto/rand’ library that
     reads ‘/dev/urandom’ source.  Some GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems
     are rather good with this entropy source.  Closed proprietary ones
     are always not and you must use optional *note EGD:: feature with
     them.

User manual
***********

Announcements about updates and new releases can be found in *note
contacts: Contacts.

   GoVPN is split into two pieces: *note Client:: and *note Server::.
Each of them work on top of *note UDP/TCP: Network. and TAP virtual
network interfaces.  GoVPN is just a tunnelling of Ethernet frames,
nothing less, nothing more.  All you IP-related network management is
not touched by VPN at all.  You can automate it using up and down shell
scripts.

   What network performance can user expect?  For example single _Intel
i5-2450M 2.5 GHz_ core on _FreeBSD 10.2 amd64_ with _Go 1.5.1_ gives 786
Mbps (UDP transport) throughput.

Entropy Gathering Daemon
------------------------

Overall security mainly depends on client side: *note good passphrase:
PAKE. and cryprographically good pseudo random number generator.

   Some operating systems do not have good enough quality PRNG, bad
‘/dev/urandom’.  You should use separate PRNG with them.  GoVPN
communicates with them using Entropy Gathering Daemon
(http://egd.sourceforge.net/) protocol.

   To switch using EGD-compatible daemons instead of ‘crypto/rand’
library you provide ‘-egd PATH’ command line option, where ‘PATH’ is the
domain socket.

% ./govpn-server [...] -egd /var/run/egd.sock


File: govpn.info,  Node: Identity,  Next: PAKE,  Prev: EGD,  Up: Glossary

Identity
--------

Client’s identity is 128-bit string.  It is not secret, so can be
transmitted and stored in the clear.  However handshake applies PRP on
it to make DPI and deanonymization much harder to success.  It is used
as a salt in *note Verifier::.


File: govpn.info,  Node: PAKE,  Next: Timeout,  Prev: Identity,  Up: Glossary

Password Authenticated Key Agreement
------------------------------------

GoVPN uses strong password authentication.  That means that it uses
human memorable *passphrases*, instead of some small high-entropy keys
that must be carried with himself.  Passphrases differ from passwords:
they are long string of low-entropy characters – they are easy to
remember and can have high overall entropy.

   Strong zero-knowledge authentication means that:

   • compromising of passphrase files on either server or client sides
     won’t allow attackers to masquerade himself the client;
   • no need of protected secure storage on the server’s side to keep
     keys in safety.

   Passphrases are entered directly by the human on the client side.
Server side stores pre-shared *note verifier: Verifier, containing
dictionary attack resistant passphrase derivative.  Attacker can not use
it to act as a client.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Timeout,  Next: Timesync,  Prev: PAKE,  Up: Glossary

Timeout
-------

Because of stateless UDP nature there is no way to reliably know if
remote peer is alive.  That is why timeouts are necessary.  If no
packets are sent during timeout period, then remote peer is considered
to be dead.  Timeout option should be synchronized both for server and
client.

   If there were no packets at all during fourth part of timeout, then
special heartbeat packet is sent.  So VPN connection should be alive all
the time, even if there is no traffic in corresponding TAP interfaces.
*Beware*: this consumes traffic.

   Stale peers and handshake states are cleaned up every timeout period.

   This applies to TCP connections too: relatively much time can pass
until we understand that remote TCP peer is suddenly died and did not
normally terminate connection.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Timesync,  Next: Network,  Prev: Timeout,  Up: Glossary

Time synchronization
--------------------

DPI systems can be active.  They could intercept first (assuming
handshake) packets and repeat them again sooner.  Without the correct
PRP-authentication, server won’t answer them, but repeated ones are
still valid.  In that case DPI will get the answer from the server,
probably without noise padding and understand that it is GoVPN server’s
handshake packet.

   Time synchronization requirement could be used for preventing this.
Client and server clocks must be synced together more or less.  You
enable it by specifying ‘-timesync’ option with allowable time accuracy
(time window width) in seconds.

   Each handshake’s packet PRP authentication just XORed with current
timestamp rounded to ‘timesync’ number of seconds.  Timesync option is
higher: less clock synchronization accuracy required, but bigger time
window of possible packet repeating.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Network,  Next: Scripts,  Prev: Timesync,  Up: Glossary

Network transport
-----------------

You can use either UDP or TCP underlying network transport protocols.

   TCP is more resource hungry.  Moreover because of packet loss and TCP
reliability it can lead to "meltdown" effect: significant performance
loss of underlying TCP connections.  Generally TCP is not advisable for
VPNs, but it can help with some nasty firewalls.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Scripts,  Next: Proxy,  Prev: Network,  Up: Glossary

Scripts
-------

Up- and down- scripts used as a hook executed when connection is either
established or lost.  Following environment variables are set during
their execution:

‘GOVPN_REMOTE’
     Remote peer’s address.  In client mode it is server’s address.

‘GOVPN_IFACE’
     TAP interface name.  In server mode this can be empty: that means
     that script must output its name as the first line to stdout.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Proxy,  Next: MTU,  Prev: Scripts,  Up: Glossary

Proxy
-----

You can proxy your requests through HTTP using CONNECT method.  This can
help if you are only allowed to access outside world through HTTP proxy
server.

   Server has _-proxy_ option allowing to listen on specified port and
accept HTTP request.  All of them will be treated as a CONNECT method
switching to raw TCP mode.  You can make POST request and server will
anyway switch to raw TCP mode.  You are not forced to use this option:
any external HTTP proxy server can be used.

   Client has _-proxy_ option forcing it to connect to proxy and send
CONNECT method.  Optionally it can be authenticated on it using
_-proxy-auth_ HTTP Basic method.

% govpn-client [...] -proto tcp \
    -remote "$REMOTE_ADDR":1194 \
    -proxy 192.168.55.1:8888 \
    -proxy-auth mylogin:password


File: govpn.info,  Node: MTU,  Next: Stats,  Prev: Proxy,  Up: Glossary

Maximum Transmission Unit
-------------------------

MTU option tells what maximum transmission unit is expected to get from
TAP interface.  It is per-user configuration.  Incoming packets of
bigger sizes (including the padding byte) will be ignored.  If either
*note noise: Noise, *note encryptionless mode: Encless. or *note CPR::
are enabled, then all outgoing packets are filled up to that MTU value.

   Default MTU equals to 1514 bytes (1500 bytes of Ethernet payload, 14
bytes of Ethernet header).


File: govpn.info,  Node: Stats,  Next: Noise,  Prev: MTU,  Up: Glossary

Statistics
----------

Both client and server has ability to show statistics about known
connected peers.  You retrieve them by downloading JSON from built-in
background HTTP-server.  You can enable it by specifying ‘-stats
host:port’ argument.

   Actually it is not full-fledged HTTP-server: it just accepts
connection, reads from it (does not parse anything) and writes dummy
headers with JSON document.

% govpn-server [...] -stats "[::1]:5678"
% curl http://localhost:5678/ | jq .

  }

File: govpn.info,  Node: Noise,  Next: CPR,  Prev: Stats,  Up: Glossary

Noise
-----

So-called noise is used to hide underlying payload packets length.
Without it GoVPN provides confidentiality and authenticity of messages,
but not their timestamps of appearance and sizes.

   You may turn on ‘-noise’ option, that forces to fill up all outgoing
packets to their maximum (MTU) size.  As it can be applied only to
outgoing traffic, you should enable it on both sides in most cases.

   Pay attention that this can dramatically *increase* your traffic!  It
is turned off by default.


File: govpn.info,  Node: CPR,  Next: Encless,  Prev: Noise,  Up: Glossary

Constant Packet Rate
--------------------

Constant Packet Rate is used to hide fact of underlying payload packets
appearance.  In this mode daemon inserts necessary dummy packets and
delays other ones.

   This mode is turned by ‘-cpr’ option, where you specify desired
outgoing traffic rate in KiB/sec (kibibytes per second).  This option
also *forces* using of the *note noise: Noise.!  It is turned off by
default.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Encless,  Next: Verifier,  Prev: CPR,  Up: Glossary

Encryptionless mode
-------------------

Some jurisdictions can force user to reveal his encryption keys.
However they can not ask for authentication (signing) keys.  So you are
safe to use authentication algorithms, but not the encryption ones.
Moreover some countries forbids usage of encryption (but again not the
authentication).

   GoVPN provides special encryptionless mode of operation.  In this
mode it replaces Salsa20 function used for confidentiality with rather
well-known Chaffing-and-Winnowing
(http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/chaffing-980701.txt) (CnW)
technology.  This is rather traffic and resource hungry algorithm, so we
use it after All-Or-Nothing-Transformation
(http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/rivest/fusion.ps) (based on Optimal
Asymmetric Encryption Padding
(http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oaep.html)) on the data.  This is
confidentiality preserving encoding.

   AONT is just a keyless encoding of the data.  CnW uses only
authentication function.  Handshake additionally uses Diffie-Hellman and
signature algorithms.  No encryption and steganography involved.

   In this mode each outgoing packet became larger on 4128 bytes and
*note noise: Noise. is forcefully enabled.  So this is resource hungry
mode!

   *Beware*: by default packet serial numbers are still processed
through the XTEA encryption.  It is not required for confidentiality and
security, but for randomizing some parts of the traffic to make it
indistinguishable from the noise, for making it more DPI-proof.  It
safely can be disabled, turned off or maybe its keys even can be
revealed without security and forward secrecy loss.

   See ‘govpn/cnw’ and ‘govpn/aont’ packages for details of AONT and
chaffing operations.


File: govpn.info,  Node: Verifier,  Prev: Encless,  Up: Glossary

Verifier
--------

Verifier is created using ‘govpn-verifier’ utility.

% govpn-verifier
Passphrase:[hello world]
$argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg$KCNIqfS4DGsBTtVytamAzcISgrlEWvNxan1UfBrFu10
$argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg

   First line is the verifier for the server side.  Second line is for
the client – it lacks generated public key.  However you can use
server’s one on the client side too.

   You can check passphrase against verifier by specifying ‘-verifier’
option with the path to verifier file:

% govpn-verifier -verifier '$argon2d...'
Passphrase:[hello world]
true

   Optionally you can store plaintext passphrases on volatile memory
(memory disk, encrypted filesystem with restrictive permissions to the
file) and provide ‘-key’ option.

Client part
===========

Except for common *note -stats: Stats, *note -egd: EGD. options client
has the following ones:

‘-mtu’
     Expected TAP interface *note MTU::.

‘-proto’
     *note Network protocol: Network. to use.  Can be either _udp_
     (default) or _tcp_.

‘-proxy’
     Use specified _host:port_ *note Proxy:: server for accessing remote
     server.

‘-proxy-auth’
     Optional _user:password_ for HTTP Basic authorization on proxy
     server.

‘-remote’
     Address (‘host:port’ format) of remote server we need to connect
     to.

‘-iface’
     TAP interface name.

‘-verifier’
     Our client’s *note Verifier::.

‘-key’
     Path to the file with the passphrase.  If omitted, then you will be
     asked to enter it in the terminal.

‘-timeout’
     *note Timeout:: setting in seconds.

‘-timesync’
     Optional *note time synchronization: Timesync. requirement.  If set
     to zero, then no synchronization required.

‘-noise’
     Enable *note Noise::.

‘-cpr’
     Set *note CPR:: in KiB/sec.

‘-encless’
     Enable *note encryptionless mode: Encless.

‘-up’
     Optional path to *note script: Scripts. that will be executed after
     connection is established.  Interface name will be given to it as a
     first argument.

‘-down’
     Same as ‘-up’ above, but it is executed when connection is lost,
     when we exit.

   Example up-script that calls DHCP client and IPv6 advertisement
solicitation:

client% cat > up.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
dhclient $GOVPN_IFACE
rtsol $GOVPN_IFACE
EOF
client% chmod +x up.sh


File: govpn.info,  Node: Server,  Next: Example,  Prev: Client,  Up: User

Server part
===========

Except for common *note -stats: Stats, *note -egd: EGD. options client
has the following ones:

‘-proto’
     *note Network protocol: Network. to use.  Can be _udp_ (default),
     _tcp_ or _all_.

‘-bind’
     Address (‘host:port’ format) we must bind to.

‘-conf’
     Path to YAML file with the configuration.

‘-proxy’
     Start trivial HTTP *note Proxy:: server on specified _host:port_.

   Configuration file is YAML file with following example structure:

stargrave: {                        <-- Peer human readable name
    iface: tap10                    <-- OPTIONAL TAP interface name
    mtu: 1514                       <-- OPTIONAL overriden MTU
    up: ./stargrave-up.sh           <-- OPTIONAL up-script
    down: ./stargrave-down.sh       <-- OPTIONAL down-script
    timeout: 60                     <-- OPTIONAL overriden timeout
    timesync: 0                     <-- OPTIONAL time synchronization requirement
    noise: No                       <-- OPTIONAL noise enabler
    cpr: 64                         <-- OPTIONAL constant packet rate, KiB/sec
    encless: No                     <-- OPTIONAL Encryptionless mode
    verifier: $argon2d...           <-- verifier received from client
[...]

   At least one of either ‘iface’ or ‘up’ must be specified.  If you
specify ‘iface’, then it will be forcefully used to determine what TAP
interface will be used.  If it is not specified, then up-*note script:
Scripts. must output interface’s name to stdout (first output line).

   For example up-script can be just ‘echo tap10’, or more advanced like
the following one:

#!/bin/sh
$tap=$(ifconfig tap create)
ifconfig $tap inet6 fc00::1/96 mtu 1412 up
echo $tap

   Each minute server rereads and refreshes peers configuration and adds
newly appeared identities, deletes an obsolete ones.

   You can use convenient ‘utils/newclient.sh’ script for new client
creation:

% ./utils/newclient.sh Alice
[...]
Your client verifier is: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg

Place the following YAML configuration entry on the server's side:

    Alice:
        up: /path/to/up.sh
        iface: or TAP interface name
        verifier: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg$KCNIqfS4DGsBTtVytamAzcISgrlEWvNxan1UfBrFu10

   Example configuration file:
stargrave:
    iface: tap0
    verifier: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$VMirzcshcHuG2V4jhUsEjw$X5fC07L8k61h3S1Oro/rC76+m0oGDTA9Bq+aWJ1uOgY

Example usage
=============

Let’s assume that there is some insecure link between your computer and
WiFi-reachable gateway.

   • You have got ‘wlan0’ NIC with 192.168.0/24 network on it.
   • You want to create virtual encrypted and authenticated 172.16.0/24
     network and use it as a default transport.
   • Assume that outgoing GoVPN packets can be fragmented, so we do not
     bother configuring MTU of TAP interfaces.  For better performance
     just lower it and check that no fragmentation of outgoing UDP
     packets occurs.

   *Install*.  At first you must *note install: Installation. this
software: download, *note check the signature: Integrity, compile.

   *Prepare the client*.  Generate client’s verifier for Alice as an
example:

client% ./utils/newclient.sh Alice
Passphrase:
Your client verifier is: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg

Place the following YAML configuration entry on the server's side:

    Alice:
        up: /path/to/up.sh
        iface: or TAP interface name
        verifier: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg$KCNIqfS4DGsBTtVytamAzcISgrlEWvNxan1UfBrFu10

   *Prepare the server*.  Add this entry to ‘peers.yaml’ configuration
file:

Alice:
    iface: tap10
    verifier: $argon2d$m=4096,t=128,p=1$bwR5VjeCYIQaa8SeaI3rqg$KCNIqfS4DGsBTtVytamAzcISgrlEWvNxan1UfBrFu10

   *Prepare network on GNU/Linux IPv4 server*:

server% ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev wlan0
server% ip tuntap add dev tap10 mode tap
server% ip addr add 172.16.0.1/24 dev tap10
server% ip link set up dev tap10

Verifier structure
==================

Verifier is a derivative of the password.  It is resistant to dictionary
attacks and can not be used for authentication (only its verifying).

SOURCE = Argon2d(m, t, p, SALT=PeerId, PASSWORD)
PUB, PRIV = Ed25519.Generate(SOURCE)

   Verifier is serialized representation of public data above:
$argon2d$m=m,t=t,p=p$Base64(SALT)$Base64(PUB)

   m, t and p parameters are Argon2d-specific: memory, iterations and
parallelizm parameters.

   Server stores and knows only verifier.  Client can compute the whole
keypair every time he makes handshake.

                    |
                    +--< PRP(PRP_KEY, SERIAL)

   ‘SERIAL’ is message’s serial number.  Odds are reserved for client
(to server) messages, evens for server (to client) messages.

   ‘PRP’ is XTEA block cipher algorithm used here as PRP (pseudo random
permutation function) to obfuscate ‘SERIAL’.  Plaintext ‘SERIAL’ state
is kept in peers internal state, but encrypted before transmission.

   XTEA’s encryption key ‘PRP_KEY’ is the first 128-bit of Salsa20’s
output with established common key and zero nonce (message nonces start
from 1).

PRP_KEY = 128bit(ENCRYPT(KEY, 0))

   ‘ENCRYPT’ is Salsa20 stream cipher, with established session ‘KEY’
and obfuscated ‘SERIAL’ used as a nonce.  512 bit of Salsa20’s output is
ignored and only remaining is XORed with ther data, encrypting it.

   ‘DATA’ is padded with ‘PAD’ (0x80 byte).  Optional ‘ZEROS’ may
follow, to fill up packet to conceal payload packet length.

   ‘AUTH’ is Poly1305 authentication function.  First 256 bits of
Salsa20’s output are used as a one-time key for ‘AUTH’.

AUTH_KEY = 256bit(ENCRYPT(KEY, NONCE))

   To prevent replay attacks we must remember received ‘SERIAL’s and
drop when receiving duplicate ones.

   In *note encryptionless mode: Encless. this scheme is slightly
different:

 PACKET = ENCODED || NONCE
ENCODED = ENCLESS(DATA || PAD || ZEROS)
  NONCE = PRP(PRP_KEY, SERIAL)

   ‘ENCLESS’ is AONT and chaffing function.  There is no need in
explicit separate authentication.

   Each handshake message ends with so called ‘IDtag’: it is an XTEA
encrypted first 64 bits of each message with client’s *note Identity::
as a key.  It is used to transmit identity and to mark packet as
handshake message.

   If *note noise: Noise. is enabled, then data is padded to fill up
packet to MTU’s size.

   *Preparation stage*:

  1. Client knows only his identity and passphrase written somewhere in
     the human readable form.  Server knows his identity and *note
     verifier: Verifier structure.: ‘DSAPub’.
  2. Client computes verifier which produces ‘DSAPriv’ and ‘DSAPub’.
     ‘H()’ is _BLAKE2b-256_ hash function.
  3. Client generates DH keypair: ‘CDHPub’ and ‘CDHPriv’.  Also it
     generates random 64-bit ‘R’ that is used as a nonce for symmetric
     encryption.  ‘El()’ is Elligator point encoding (and vice versa)
     algorithm.

   *Interaction stage*:

  1. R + enc(H(DSAPub), R, El(CDHPub)) + IDtag -> Server [48 bytes]

  2.    • Server remembers client address.
        • Decrypts ‘El(CDHPub)’.
        • Inverts ‘El()’ encoding and gets ‘CDHPub’.
        • Generates DH keypair: ‘SDHPriv’/‘SDHPub’.
        • Computes common shared key ‘K = H(DH(SDHPriv, CDHPub))’.
        • Generates 64-bit random number ‘RS’.
        • Generates 256-bit pre-master secret ‘SS’.

  3. 
     enc(H(DSAPub), R+1, El(SDHPub)) + enc(K, R, RS + SS) + IDtag -> Client
     [80 bytes]

  4.    • Client decrypts ‘El(SDHPub)’.
        • Inverts ‘El()’ encoding and gets ‘SDHPub’.
        • Computes ‘K’.
        • Decrypts ‘RS’ and ‘SS’.
        • Remembers ‘SS’.
        • Generates 64-bit random number ‘RC’.
        • Generates 256-bit pre-master secret ‘SC’.
        • Signs with ‘DSAPriv’ key ‘K’.

  5. enc(K, R+1, RS + RC + SC + Sign(DSAPriv, K)) + IDtag -> Server [120
     bytes]

  6.    • Server decrypts ‘RS’, ‘RC’, ‘SC’, ‘Sign(DSAPriv, K)’.

        • Compares ‘RS’ with its own one sent before.  Server decrypts
          ‘RS’, ‘RC’, ‘SC’ with key ‘K’, compares ‘RS’ with its own one
          sent before.

        • Verifies ‘K’ signature with verifier ‘DSAPub’.

        • Computes final session encryption key: ‘MasterKey=SS XOR SC’.

  7. ENC(K, R+2, RC) + IDtag -> Client [16 bytes]

  8.    • Client decrypts ‘RC’
        • Compares with its own one sent before.
        • Computes final session encryption key as server did.

   ‘MasterKey’ is high entropy 256-bit key.  ‘K’ DH-derived one has
128-bit security margin and that is why are not in use except in
handshake process.  ‘R*’ are required for handshake randomization and
two-way authentication.

   In *note encryptionless mode: Encless. each ‘enc()’ is replaced with
AONT and chaffing function over the noised data.

     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
     document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
     Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and
     no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the
     section entitled "Copying conditions".

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
